                What began as a chamber built on courtroom advocacy has, over three
                decades, grown into a full-service practice spanning corporate law,
                admiralty and maritime disputes, tax and customs, labour and employment,
                banking and finance, intellectual property, and alternative dispute
                resolution. Throughout that growth, the founding principle has stayed
                the same: meticulous documentation, robust representation, and the
                highest standard of professional and ethical conduct – in the courtroom
                and out of it.
